This dataset contains data on all bike trips taken in July, August, and
September of 2013 on Washington, DC's bikeshare program. The data is cleaned
and some of the original variables were removed to reduce the data size. (The
data is approximately 10 MB.)

For the cleaning script (not yet finished), see
